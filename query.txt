Subject: Summary of Environmental Impact Assessment

Hi Team,

Below is a brief overview of our recent environmental impact assessment:

    Air Emissions: Our operations generate around 150,000 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent annually, plus additional pollutants. We’re upgrading filtration systems to reduce these emissions.

    Water Management: We use roughly 10 million liters of water each year. New treatment processes are being introduced to lower discharge risks.

    Waste Generation: We currently recycle about 60% of our waste. Efforts to improve waste segregation and reduce hazardous waste are underway.

    Energy Consumption: While fossil fuels dominate our energy mix, we aim to reduce overall energy use by 15% over the next five years through efficiency improvements and a shift toward renewables.

    Land Use: Our activities have reduced nearby green space. In response, we’ve launched tree planting and habitat restoration initiatives.

We remain committed to reducing our environmental footprint and are actively exploring further sustainable practices.

Best regards,
